  area/element.

**Low contrast diffs**

There is currently no way to theme changed characters within the overall
block of changed text in a diff. Instead the characters are hardcoded to be a
shade lighter than the contained text block. With the dark and
semi-transparent colors in this theme, the changed characters don't stand out
much.

If you feel the need you can set your own colors by choosing `Preferences:
Open Settings (JSON)` from the command palette, then adding your preferred `diffEditor` colors under `workbench.colorCustomizations`. The following example uses
the same colors as the default dark theme.

```jsonc
// User settings.json
"workbench.colorCustomizations": {
	"[Dark and Cool]": {
		"diffEditor.insertedTextBackground": "#9bb95533",
		"diffEditor.removedTextBackground": "#ff000033"
	}
},
```

This feature request for the ability to theme changed characters is tracked at
[microsoft/vscode#103207][vscode#103207] and has been under consideration since
September 2020.

**Unthemed elements**
- tags (`"recently used"`) in command palette and settings dropdowns
